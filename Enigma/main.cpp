 USAGE: enigma []
 
 PARAMETERS:
    -g --generate       Generates random key file.
 
 CONFIGURATION:
    -r --rotors         Sets rotors in visible order (as seen on the physical machine, electrical current enters and exits the last rotor)
 
        Rotors can be specified by:
        1) Rotor name, all recognized rotor names are:
                        - c1, c2, c3, (Commercial Enigma A, B - 1924)
                        - gr1, gr2, gr3, (German Railway, Rocket - 1941)
                        - k1, k2, k3, (Swiss K - 1939)
                        - w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8, (military rotors - 1930-1939)
                        - w_beta, w_gamma (military rotors - 1940-1942)
 
        2) Explicit rotor wiring (any permutation of 26 alphabetic letters ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ without fixed point)
 
        Additional:
            - to set turnover points, add indices 0-25 and / before the wiring (named rotors have turnover points already set up)
              (index n means that when the rotor is stepping from n to n+1, turnover will occur)
              e.g. 8/12/18/FKQHTLXOCBJSPDZRAMEWNIUYGV
 
            - to specify a starting offset, add : and index 0-25 after the name or wiring
              (starting offset 0 means "as-is")
              e.g. c1:23, FKQHTLXOCBJSPDZRAMEWNIUYGV:17
 
            - default turnover points are none (unless you're using a named rotor), default starting offset is 0
 
            - you can specify as many rotors as you like, but keep in mind that a lot of them might slow down the encryption/decryption process
 
            - separate all rotors by a comma without space
 
        Example usage: -r w8:19,k3,1/8/19/FKQHTLXOCBJSPDZRAMEWNIUYGV:3
 
    -rf --reflector     Sets the reflector
 
        Reflector can be specified by:
        1) Reflector name, all recognized reflector names are:
                        - gr_ukw (German Railway, Rocket - 1941),
                        - k_ukw (Swiss K - 1939)
                        - w_ra, w_rb, w_rc (military rotors - 1930-1942)
                        - w_rbt, w_rct (thin versions of military rotors B and C)
 
        2) Explicit reflector wiring (same as with rotors, but the permutation has to be involution = inverse to itself)
            Here are few examples of what's a valid reflector wiring (only 4 letters are used for clarity)
            e.g. ABCD is valid, DBCA is valid, ACBD is valid, CBAD is valid, BCDA is invalid
 
        Additional:
            - similarly to rotors, you can specify offset of a reflector by adding : and index 0-25
              e.g. w_ra:21, YRUHQSLDPXNGOKMIEBFZCWVJAT:6
 
            - unlike rotors, the reflector does not change offset during the encryption/decryption process
 
    -p --plugs          Configures the plugboard
 
        Plugboard swaps pairs of letters as they enter the rotor assembly, these letters are separated by commas (without spaces), and cannot repeat.
        e.g. AD,PL,FY
 
        Additional:
            - since the swap occurs bidirectionally, the order of the letters doesn't matter (AD = DA, what's more AD,PL = PL,AD)
